                        MedicareSaver is a referral source that provides information
                        and access to a helpline to match consumers with companies
                        that may provide certain insurance coverage to them.
                        MedicareSaver does not act as an insurance broker and does
                        not make decisions about insurance coverage that may be
                        available to you. MedicareSaver doesnâ€™t promise a specific
                        outcome or the results you may achieve by calling the
                        helpline. The helpline is free to call but the services or
                        programs that you pursue may have costs associated with
                        them. Neither MedicareSaver nor any of the supplemental
                        insurance plans to which you may be connected are endorsed
                        by the U.S. Government or the federal Medicare program.
